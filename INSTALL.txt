Installation is easy, simply enable the module and it will provide at least
some basic level of functionality at admin/content/types/schemr/view.

If you want to take advantage of the PDF output support you need to install
the FPDF library. To do this, visit http://www.fpdf.org/, click Downloads,
and download the latest ZIP or TGZ file to your server (current 1.7). Unpack
it into schemr/fpdf. If you do this properly, you should have a
schemr/fpdf/fpdf.php file on your server, and the PDF option will
automatically appear in the top-right of the diagram screen.

See README.txt for usage instructions.
