Installation is easy, simply enable the module and it will provide at least
some basic level of functionality.

If you want to take advantage of the PDF output support (see Diagrams below),
you need to install the FPDF library. To do this, visit http://www.fpdf.org/,
click Downloads, and download the latest ZIP or TGZ file to your server.
Unpack it into schemr/fpdf. If you do this properly, you should have a
schemr/fpdf/fpdf.php file on your server, and the PDF option will automatically
appear in the top-right of the diagram screen.
